Designing a controller that allows changing the colors of two traffic lights at an intersection. The colors of the traffic lights are determined by two sensors.
The traffic light colors change based on the presence of cars. For example, if a car approaches on street A, the light remains green until a car approaches on street B, at which point the lights change. 
The project was implemented on the Basys 3 board.
